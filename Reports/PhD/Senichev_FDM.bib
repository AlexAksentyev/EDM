	abstract = {The method is based on four fundamental features. The total spin precession frequency in the vertical plane due to the electric and magnetic dipole moments in an imperfect ring in a vertical plane is measured. The position of the ring elements is unchanged from clockwise to counter-clockwise operation. The calibration of the effective Lorentz factor using the polarization precession frequency measurement in the horizontal plane is carried out alternately in each CW and CCW operation. And the approximate relationship between the frequencies of the polarization precession in different planes is set to exclude them from mixing to the vertical frequency of the expected EDM signal at a sensitivity level approaching \$10{\textasciicircum}\{-29\}\$ \$e{\textbackslash}cdot cm\$.},
