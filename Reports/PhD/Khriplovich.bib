	abstract = {Upper limits on the electric dipole moments (EDM) of elementary particles and atoms are presented, and their physical implications are discussed. The implications following from the neutron and atomic experiments are of comparable interest. The nuclear EDMs can be studied at ion storage rings, with the expected sensitivity much better than 10−24ecm10−24ecm10{\textasciicircum}\{ - 24\} {\textbackslash}user1\{e \}\{{\textbackslash}text\{cm\}\} . This would represent a serious progress in studies of the CP-violation problem.},
