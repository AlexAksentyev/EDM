	abstract = {In  Electric  Dipole  Moment search  experiments  with polarized  beams  the  coherence  of  spin  oscillations  of particles  has  a  leading  role.  The  decoherent  effects arise  due  to  spin  tune dependence  on  particle  energy  and particle trajectory  in  focusing-bending  fields.  They  are  described  through  the  n-th  order  spin  tune  aberrations.  
Since the first order is suppressed by RF field, the second order begins to play a crucial role. It depends on the orbit 
lengthening  and  on  the  odd  order  field  components.  We  
consider  the  spin  decoherence  effects  and  methods  of  
their  compensation  in  different  channels,  electrostatic, magnetostatic   linking   the   decoherence effects   with common     characteristics such     as  the momentum compaction factor, the chromaticity and others.},

	abstract = {Precision experiments, such as the search for electric dipole moments of charged particles using storage rings, demand for an understanding of the spin dynamics with unprecedented accuracy. The ultimate aim is to measure the electric dipole moments with a sensitivity up to 15 orders in magnitude better than the magnetic dipole moment of the stored particles. This formidable task requires an understanding of the background to the signal of the electric dipole from rotations of the spins in the spurious magnetic fields of a storage ring. One of the observables, especially sensitive to the imperfection magnetic fields in the ring is the angular orientation of stable spin axis. Up to now, the stable spin axis has never been determined experimentally, and in addition, the JEDI collaboration for the first time succeeded to quantify the background signals that stem from false rotations of the magnetic dipole moments in the horizontal and longitudinal imperfection magnetic fields of the storage ring. To this end, we developed a new method based on the spin tune response of a machine to artificially applied longitudinal magnetic fields. This novel technique, called {\textbackslash}textit\{spin tune mapping\}, emerges as a very powerful tool to probe the spin dynamics in storage rings. The technique was experimentally tested in 2014 at the cooler synchrotron COSY, and for the first time, the angular orientation of the stable spin axis at two different locations in the ring has been determined to an unprecedented accuracy of better than \$2.8{\textbackslash}mu\$rad.},

It is not intended to give a complete presentation of the spin dynamic theory. Instead the most importa nt features are given without proof and details not absolutely necessary are left out. Spin depolarizing mechanisms are discussed and the cures against depolarizing especially during acceleration as utilized at COSY are outlined. A list of references is given at the end to help the reader to find more deep details on spin dynamic theory [1].},
