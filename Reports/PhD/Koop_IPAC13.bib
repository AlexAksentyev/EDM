	abstract = {In  this  paper  we  discuss  a  possibility  to  collide  co-  or  counter  rotating  ion  beams,  which  are  circulating  in  the  storage  ring  with  crossed  electric  and  magnetic  bending  fields.  One  beam  is  polarized  and  its  electric  dipole moment  (EDM)  is  aimed  to  be  measured  by  the  frozen  spin  method.  The  second  beam,  which  has  different  from  the first one the Lorentz factor and charge to mass ratio will  be  used  as  comagnetometer  sensitive  to  the  radial component of the magnetic field.  Measuring by pickups  the  relative  vertical  orbit  shift  of  two  beams,  caused  by  the  presence  of  the radial field,  one  could  cancel  the  unwanted MDM spin precession, which mimics the EDM signal.  By  proper  choice  of  the  bending  electric  and magnetic field values one could make rational the ratio of the  revolution  frequencies  of  two  beams.  Examples  of  parameters for proton-, deuteron-, hellion- and some other ion  species  EDM  storage  rings  are  presented.  Finally,  a  new  method  of  increasing  of  the  spin  coherence  time  (SCT),   so   called   “Spin   Wheel”,   is   proposed   and   its applicability to the EDM search is discussed.},
