\title{The Frozen Spin and Quasi-Frozen Spin lattice concepts}
There exist two design approaches to the problem of measuring the deuteron Electric Dipole Moment (dEDM) inside a storage ring: the Frozen Spin (FS) lattice, and the Quasi-Frozen Spin (QFS) lattice.

The FS ring design concept's main objective is the maximization of the EDM signal. In the case of a single particle, this can be accomplished if its spin is continuously aligned with the momentum vector in the horizontal plane: the so-called Frozen Spin condition. The continuous fullfilment of this condition, required by the FS method, is problematic for the following reasons:
\begin{itemize}
\item since the spin precession frequency $\vec\W = -\frac{q}{m}\bkt*{G\vec B + \bkt{\frac{1}{\gamma^2-1}-G}\vec\beta\times\vec E}$,~\cite{JEDI:SpinTuneMapping} the EDM of particles with a negative magnetic anomaly $G = (g-2)/2$ (such as the deuteron) cannot be measured using either a purely electrostatic or a purely magnetic ring, and so requires the use of combined E+B field elements, placed inside the accelerator arcs;
\item even so, for the given values of E- and B-fields, there exists a unique $\gamma$, for which the FS condition holds strictly, meaning that for the majority of the beam particles that condition is fulfilled only approximately in any case.
\end{itemize}
This last point is the major motivation for the use of a Quasi-Frozen Spin ring design.

The Quasi-Frozen Spin design concept consists in correcting the necessarily occurring MDM spin rotation in the magnetic arcs by a reverse rotation in the straight sections. The ring can be implemented in two versions: one in which the E- and B-field elements are separated, and another in which the combined E+B elements are located in the straight sections of the lattice.~\cite{Senichev:Shanghai}

In the first option, the ring is made up of two types of arcs: magnetic, in each of which the closed orbit is bent by an angle $\Phi^B_{co} = \pi + 2\alpha$, and the spin is rotated, accordingly, by $\Phi^B_{spin} = \st^B\cdot \Phi^B_{co}$, and electrostatic, with the closed orbit bend angle $\Phi^E_{co} = -2\alpha$, and $\Phi^E_{spin} = \st^E\cdot \Phi^E_{co}$. The Quasi-Frozen Spin condition in this case can be formulated simply as $\Phi^E_{spin} + \Phi^B_{spin} = 0$. One drawback of this lattice is the use of cylindrical electrostatic deflectors, and the non-linearities involved.

In the second option, straight E+B spin rotators (placed in the straight sections) are used to compensate the arc MDM rotation. 

If the spin vector oscillates in the horizontal plane with an amplitude $\Phi$, the EDM signal is reduced by a factor $1 - \frac{\Phi^2}{4}$. In a QFS ring with $n$-periodicity, the spin oscillates relative to the momentum vector within half the value of the advanced spin phase $\gamma G \cdot \frac{\pi}{2n}$.~\cite{Senichev:Shanghai} In our designs, with the accelerator length approximately 150 meters, $\Phi\approx 0.25$, and hence the signal is reduced by no more than 2\%.
