\begin{abstract}
  The purpose of the present work is to evaluate the capability of the frequency-based approach
  to the measurement of the electric dipole moment of a charged particle in a storage ring environment.

  For that purpose, we analyzed several effects of the beam spin dynamics, which could result in systematic
  errors in the electric dipole moment estimator statistic. Those are: spin motion perturbations caused by
  betatron oscillations; spin decoherence in the frozen spin regime; properties of the magnetic dipole
  moment faking signal.

\section{Introduction}
The search for the electric dipole moments of elementary particles is motivated by the question of
the baryon asymmetry of the universe. In his seminal 1967 paper~\cite{Sakharov:Baryogenesis} A. Sakharov
proposed CP-symmetry violation as one of the conditions for baryogenesis.
Permanent electric dipole moments (EDMs), if they exist, violate both the P- and T-symmerties, and hence,
via the CPT-theorem, can be linked to CP-symmetry violation.

At the same time, the Standard Model (SM) predicts exceedingly small values for nucleon EDMs,
in the range of $10^{-33}$ to $10^{-31}~e\cdot$cm,
which is way below the current upper bound for the neuteron EDM,
with $d_n = 2.9\cdot 10^{-26}~e\cdot$cm. This implies that particle EDMs can serve as a powerful tool
for discovering physics beyond the SM. For example, CP-violations that are endemic in
supersymmetric teories (SUSY) are such as to span $d_n$ values in the range of
$10^{-29}$ to $10^{-24}~e\cdot$cm.~\cite{JEDI}

Up until now, all EDM-searching experiments were carried out with electrically-neutral particles, such as
atoms or the neuteron. The idea of searching of a charged particle's EDM in a storage ring environment
appeared during the development of the g-2 experiment~\cite{BNL:g-2:2001} in Brookhaven National Laboratory.

The original method proposal~\cite{BNL:Deuteron2008} consisted in observing a slow and gradual
growth of the vertical component of polarization in an initially fully longitudinally-polarized beam
injected into a storage ring in which spin precession due to the magnetic dipole moment (MDM) is suppressed.
Since the MDM component of spin precession is assumed to be zero, the tilting of the polarization vector
out of the orbit plane, which causes the growth of the vertical component, is an indication of the existence
of something else that's turing the particles' spin-vectors. This somethig is presumed to be the EDM.

In the following, we will outline the frozen spin (FS) storage ring design concept,
on which the methodology in reference~\cite{BNL:Deuteron2008} rests. Then, we will describe the characteristic
features of the frequency-based approach to EDM measurements. After that, we will present the results
of our analysis of the three major spin dynamics effects affecting the measurements.

\section{The Frozen Spin concept}
The dynamics of a spin vector $\vec s$ in a magnetic field $\vec B$ and an electrostatic field $\vec E$
is described by the Thomas-BMT equation. Its generalized version, accounting for the effect of
the particle's electric dipole moment, can be written in the rest frame as:
\begin{subequations}
  \begin{align}
    \ddt{\vec s} &= \vec s\times \underbrace{\bkt{\vec\W_{MDM} +\vec\W_{EDM}}}_{\W_s}, \label{eq:TBMT_main}
    \intertext{where the magnetic (MDM) and electric (EDM) dipole moment angular velocities
      $\vec\W_{MDM}$ and $\vec\W_{EDM}$}
    \vec\W_{MDM} &= \frac qm \bkt*{G\vec B - \bkt{G - \frac{1}{\gamma^2-1}}\frac{\vec E\times\vec\beta}{c}},\label{eq:TBMT_MDM} \\
    \vec\W_{EDM} &= \frac qm \frac\eta2 \bkt*{\frac{\vec E}c + \vec\beta\times \vec B}.\label{eq:TBMT_EDM}
  \end{align}
\end{subequations}
In the above equations, $m,~q,~G=(g-2)/2$ are, respectively, the mass, charge, and anomalous magnetic moment
of the particle; $\beta = \sfrac{v_0}{c}$ is its normalized speed; $\gamma$ its Lorentz-factor.
The EDM factor $\eta$ is defined by the equation $d = \eta\frac{q}{2mc}$, in which $d$ is the particle EDM,
$s$ its spin.

If the storage ring's radial electric field component~\cite[p.~10]{BNL:Deuteron2008}
\[
E_r = \frac{GB_yc\beta\gamma^2}{1-G\beta^2\gamma^2},
\]
the
MDM component in~\eqref{eq:TBMT_main} is set to zero: $\vec\W_{MDM} = \vec 0$, and we are said
to be operating in the frozen spin (also called ``spin transparent'') regime.

In this case, the vertical polarization vector component is expected to be a harmonic signal
\begin{equation}\label{eq:Py_growth}
 P_y = A\cdot \sin\bkt{\underbrace{\sqrt{(\wedm + \wimp)^2 + \w_y^2 + \w_z^2}}_{\W}\cdot t + \delta},
\end{equation}
where $\wimp$ denotes the MDM spin precession frequency generated by fields connected
with machine imperfections. It is the primary source of systematic error in the storage ring
EDM search experiment based on the classical, i.e. 3D, FS idea.

According to equation~\eqref{eq:Py_growth}, two distinct measurement modes can be conceptualized in the FS
measurement framework:
\begin{enumerate*}
\item the amplitude-, and
\item the frequency-based methods.
\end{enumerate*}

The former is the classical 3D FS measurement methodology: all EDM-unrelated precession in the ring
must first be suppressed; then, if the beam's polarization vector doesn't hold still,
it indicates to us that something else (the EDM) exists that's turning it.

In the frequency-based methodology~\cite{Senichev:FDM}, on the other hand, spin precession
is stopped only in the beam orbit plane,
and the EDM indicator is the change to the vertical plane spin precession frequency under time reversal
(the time reversal is simulated by reversing the beam circulation direction).

We call the state in which the beam particles' spins are frozen in the horiozontal,
but precess freely in the vertical, plane the 2D FS -- or the spin wheel (SW)~\cite{Mane:SpinWheel} -- state.
In view of this, the frequency-based methodology will also be referred to as the 2D Frozen Spin method.

Three advatages follow from not freezing the spin precession in the vertical plane:
\begin{enumerate}[(i)]
\item since we don't have to stop vertical plane MDM spin precession, lattice optical element alignment
  specifications aren't as stringent;
\item it also means that the spin precession axis is more stable, which is a remedy for another major
  systematic error -- geometric phase;\label{itm:advantages:stability}
\item and since we don't have to measure microradian deviations of the polarization vector from the
  beam orbit plane, the polarization measurement is much easier.
\end{enumerate}

\paragraph{The frequency-based methodology's characteristic features}

The frequency-based approach is characterized by two main features:
\begin{enumerate}
\item The existence of the EDM is inferred not from the change in the beam polarization vector's
  spatial orientation \emph{itself}, but from the shift in the spatial orientation's \emph{rate of change};
\item The fields induced by machine imperfections, instead of being suppressed,
  are used as a spin wheel driver.
  \begin{itemize}
  \item The spin wheel's roll direction is reversed by flipping the direction of the guide field;
  \item its roll rate is controlled through observation of spin precession in the horizontal plane.
  \end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}

\paragraph{Used terminology}
For terminology's sake, we should note that in the standard formalism one operates with
the spin transfer matrix~\cite[p.~4]{COSY:SpinTuneMapping}
\[
\boldsymbol{t}_R = \exp\bkt{-i\pi\nu_s\vec\sigma\cdot\bar n} = \cos\pi\nu_s - i (\vec\sigma\cdot\bar n)\sin\pi\nu_s,
\]
where $\nu_s = \sfrac{\W_s}{\W_{cyc}}$, the ratio of the particle's spin precession frequency to
its cyclotron frequency, is termed \emph{spin tune}, and $\bar n$, termed the \emph{invariant spin axis},
defines the spin precession axis. They relate to the spin precession angular velocity as in
\[
\vec\W_s = \w_{cyc}\cdot \nu_s\bar n.
\]

\section{Effects of spin dynamics}
\subsection{Betatron oscillations}

\subsubsection{Probem statement}
The problem of the betatron motion is as follows:
\begin{enumerate}
\item the EDM statistic is composed from two estimates of the spin precession frequency;
  in one the EDM and MDM effects add up, in the other subtract:
  \begin{equation*}
    \begin{cases}
      \hat\w_{edm} &= \frac12(\hat\w_x^+ + \hat\w_x^-),\\
      \w_x^\pm &= \w_{edm} \pm \w_{mdm}.
    \end{cases}
  \end{equation*}
\item Those frequencies are estimated via fitting a harmonic function with constant parameters to
  polarimety data:
\[
f(t) = a\cdot\sin(\w_x\cdot t + \delta) \mapsto \hat\w_x,
\]
\[
(a,\w_x,\delta) = \const.
\]

\item At the same time, the solution of the T-BMT equation for the vertical spin vector component
  has a non-constant amplitude $a = \sqrt{\nbar_x^2 + (\nbar_y\cdot\nbar_z)^2}$
  for a betatron-oscillating particle.
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Simulation setup}\label{sec:betatron:simulation}
In the simulation we used a FS lattice with bent E+B-field spin rotators
shown in Figure~\ref{fig:BNL_lattice}.
We used an imperfect machine; imperfections were simulated by spin-rotator tilts about the optic axis.
The tilt angles were normally-diftributed, each trial the expectation of the tilt distribution was varied.
The non-zero expectation value simulates the application of a spin wheel driver.
Imperfections introduced in this way affect only the particle spin dynamics,
leaving the orbital dynamics the same for every trial.

\begin{figure}[h]
  \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{img/BNL_lattice}
  \caption{Frozen Spin lattice used in all simulations. Bent E+B-field spin-rotators are inserted
    into the arc sections. The lattice length is 146 m,
    the beam injection energy is 270 MeV. Image taken from~\cite{Senichev:Lattices}.\label{fig:BNL_lattice}}
\end{figure}


Particles injected into the alttice were betatron-scillating in the vertical plane for the most part.
Since 270 MeV is not exactly the FS energy\footnote{The more precise value is 270.0092 MeV}
for this lattice, the radial component of the spin precession axis is fairly small. This, however,
does not pose a problem for this particular simulations, since it only amplifies the effect of vertical
betatron oscillations, which were being studied.

In the analysis we used three data sets. The $s_y^{trk}$ time series was taken directly
from the COSY Infinity~\cite{COSYInf} tracker. The $s_y^{gen}$ were data generated using a harmonic function
with varying amplitude and frequency; the amplitude and frequency values at time $t$ were computed based
on the invariant spin axis and spin tune time series obtained during COSY Infinity tracking.
The $s_y^{idl}$ data seres was also computed from the harmonic signal, but constant estimates of
amplitude and frequency were used.

From the data series, two comparator statistics/residuals were computed:
\begin{align*}
  \epsilon_1(t) &= s_y^{gen}(t) - s_y^{idl}(t), \tag{generator residual}\\
  \epsilon_2(t) &= s_y^{trk}(t) - s_y^{idl}(t). \tag{tracker residual}
\end{align*}

The tracker residual serves as an estimate of the amplitude oscillations
caused by the particle's betatron motion, and hence it is the primary statistic for analysis.

\subsubsection{Simulation results and conclusions}

In Figure~\ref{fig:smp:resid_vs_time} are shown the time-dependencies of the comparator
residuals. These are plots for the particle with the largest (3 mm) amplitude of betatron oscillations.
We observe that even in this case the tracker residual's oscillation amplitude does not exceed
$10^{-5}$; for a whole ensemble of particles, this value can only be smaller, due to the averaging effect.

The amplitude growth in the generator residual's case is due to the difference between the ideal
and generator signal's oscillation frequencies, which is a consequence of the way in which we defined the
ideal signal's parameters.
\begin{figure}[h]
  \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{img/smp_sim/residual_vs_time(both)}
  \caption{Comparator statistics' time-dependence.\label{fig:smp:resid_vs_time}}
\end{figure}

Figure~\ref{fig:smp} presents the most significant simulation results. We make two observations:
\begin{enumerate}[(1)]
\item the comparator's standard deviations follow the same functional dependence on the SW driver's
  strength as the spin tune's, and do not show any interest in the behavior of the spin precession axis;
\item the variability of the precession axis grows smaller as the driver strength increases. This is
  what we referred to as advantage~\ref{itm:advantages:stability} of the frequency-based approach.
\end{enumerate}

\begin{figure}[h]\centering
  \begin{subfigure}{\linewidth}
    \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{img/smp_sim/residual_SD_vs_SW(both)}

  \end{subfigure}
  \caption{Effect of betatron oscillations on the particle spin dynamics simulation results.\label{fig:smp}}
\end{figure}

This simulation was set up so as to check the robustness of the frequency-based approach's EDM statistic
with regard to perturbations to the particle spin dynamics; specifically, those that cause the invariant
spin axis to change its orientation. Even though the only source of perturbation we used was
the particles' betatron motion, some general conclusions can be inferred from the results:
\begin{enumerate}[(1)]
\item The amplitude oscillations are small, as evidenced by Figure~\ref{fig:smp:resid_vs_time} (directly),
  and the residual standard deviation plots in Figure~\ref{fig:smp:resid} (indirectly). We expect the
  random polarization measurement error to occur at the percent level, which means that the superposition
  of this systematic error with the random measurement error should not exhibit any
  statistically-significant systematicity.
\item The correllation coefficient between the $\hat a$- and $\hat\w_x$-estimates is less than 10\%.
  The measured signal's amplitude oscillations affect the amplitude estimate in the first place, while
  their effect on the frequency estimate is described by the correllation coefficient. Since it is small,
  even if our first conclusion is false, and the amplitude oscillations are sufficient to bias the
  $\hat a$-estimate, their effect on the frequency estimate will be attenuated by at least a factor of 10.
\item This systematic effect is controllable. This can be observed in Figure~\ref{fig:smp:NBAR}, where
  the precession axis' variability goes down with the SW roll rate. The frequency-based approach permits
  the application of a SW driver in a reasonably wide strength range.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Spin decoherence}
\subsubsection{Origins}
According to equation $\nu_s = \gamma G$, a particle's spin tune depends on its energy. Because particles in
a bunch travel different length orbits, their equilibrium energy levels also experience a dispersion. As a
consequence, their spin vectors precess at different rates,
which is the immediate cause of decoherence.~\cite{Senichev:IPAC13}

In Figure~\ref{fig:long_phase_port_3} one can see the longitudinal phase space portraits of particles
doing betatron oscillations in the verticel plane. The centers of the ellipses indicate the particles'
equilibrium energy levels. Data used in the drawing of this figure was obtained in a simulation in which
third-order spin and orbital transfer maps were utilized. Compare with the linear theory prediction, represented
in Figure~\ref{fig:long_phase_port_1}.

\begin{figure}[h]\centering
  \begin{subfigure}{\linewidth}

    \caption{Particles do vertical plane betatron oscillations.
      Colors mark the particles' vertical offsets at injection; all other initial coordinate offsets are zero.

  \end{subfigure}
  \caption{Longitudinal phase space portraits in a lattice using RF bunching.}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Theory behind the sextupole decoherence suppression}
Our hypothesis is that decoherence is a result of the dispersion in the particle equilibrium energy levels.
If one solves the system of equations for the longitudinal particle dynamics,~\footnote{For details,
  please cf. reference~\cite{Aksentev:IPAC19:Decoh}.} assuming a non-linear mometnum compaction factor
$\alpha = \alpha_0 + \alpha_1\cdot\delta$, one will obtain the following general expression
for the equilibrium level momentum shift:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:equ_mom_shift}
  \Delta\delta_{eq} = \frac{\gamma_0^2}{\gamma_0^2\alpha_0 - 1}\bkt*{\frac{\delta_m^2}{2}\bkt{\alpha_1 - \alpha_0\gamma^{-2}_0 + \gamma_0^{-4}} + \bkt{\frac{\Delta L}{L}}_\beta}.
\end{equation}

In the above equation:
\begin{enumerate}
\item $\delta = \D p/p$ is the particle's momentum offset~\footnote{$\delta_m$ is
  the amplitude of synchrotron oscillations.};
\item $\gamma_0$ is the Lorentz factor of the reference particle;
\item $\bkt{\frac{\D L}{L}}_\beta = \frac{\pi}{2L}\bkt*{\epsilon_xQ_z + \epsilon_yQ_y}$ is the
  orbit lengthening due to betatron oscillations;
\item $\epsilon_{x,y}$ are, respectively, the horizontal and vertical transverse emittances, $Q_{x,y}$ the
  corresponding betatron tunes.
\end{enumerate}

The expression~\eqref{eq:equ_mom_shift} contains two terms: the first has to do with
the non-linear momentum compaction factor, the second with the particle orbit length.

If one inserts a sextupole of strength
\begin{align}
  S_{sext} &= \frac{1}{B\rho} \pddx{B_y}[x][2]
  \intertext{into the beam line, its field will first of all affect the particle trajectories:}
  \bkt{\frac{\Delta L}{L}}_{sext} &= \mp \frac{S_{sext}D_0\beta_{x,y}\varepsilon_{x,y}}{L} \label{eq:sext:OL_effect},
  \intertext{and second --- it will modify the non-linear part of the momentum compaction factor:}
  \Delta \alpha_{1,sext} &= -\frac{S_{sext}D_0^3}{L}. \label{eq:sext:MCM_effect}
\end{align}
We call equation~\eqref{eq:sext:OL_effect} the {orbit length effect},
equation~\eqref{eq:sext:MCM_effect} the {momentum compaction factor effect}.
In the following sections we will try to analyze the signatures of these effects in spin tune data.

\subsubsection{Sextupole field effect signatures}
\paragraph{Momentum compaction factor effect}

In Figure~\ref{fig:sext:MCM_effect} is drawn the dependence of a particle's mean spin tune level
on its mean energy level. In this simulation we injected an ensemble of particles with differing
initial energy offsets on the closed orbit of the FS lattice from Figure~\ref{fig:BNL_lattice}.
Since the sextupole fields do not affect the closed orbit, this simulation tests only for the
momentum compaction factor effect. 

The plot exhibits two features:
\begin{enumerate}[(1)]
\item the functional dependence $\avg{\nu_s}(\avg{\D K/K})$ changes with the field gradient;
  \item the point density distribution does not vary.
\end{enumerate}

In Figure~\ref{fig:sext:MCM_effect:LPS} we drew the particles' longitudinal phase space portraits.
We observe no change in the portraits when the sextupole field gradient is varied,
which is attributed to the particle orbit lengths' not changing.

\begin{figure}[h]\centering
  \begin{subfigure}{\linewidth}
    \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{img/decoh/STDK_3SS_D}
    \caption{Dependence of the mean level of a particle's spin tune on its mean energy level.

      The functional form of the dependence changes with the field strength.\label{fig:sext:MCM_effect}}
  \end{subfigure}
  \begin{subfigure}{\linewidth}
    \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{img/decoh/LPS_3SS_D}
    \caption{Longitudinal phase space portraits of the injected particles.
      Particles were injected on the closed orbit, hence the sextupole fields do not affect their orbit length.
      No change is observed when the field strength changes.\label{fig:sext:MCM_effect:LPS}}
  \end{subfigure}
  \caption{Analysis of the sextupole fields' momentum compaction factor effect.}
\end{figure}

\paragraph{Orbit length effect}
In this simulation, particles were injected at the same initial energy, but different vertical offsets
from the closed orbit. Because of that, they do betatron oscillations, and as a result, synchrotron oscillations.
As a consequence of equation~\eqref{eq:equ_mom_shift}, we should anticipate both sextupole field effects
in this simulation.

As predicted, Figure~\ref{fig:sext:OL_effect} exhibits two features:
\begin{enumerate}[(1)]
\item the functional dependence $\avg{\nu_s}(\avg{\D K/K})$ changes as in the previous simulation;
\item the point density distribution changes also.
\end{enumerate}

In Figure~\ref{fig:sext:OL_effect:LPS} we see that the phase portraits compress when the sextupole field gradient
is changed. This compression corresponds to the point density change, seen in Figure~\ref{fig:sext:OL_effect}.
\begin{figure}[h]\centering
  \begin{subfigure}{\linewidth}
    \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{img/decoh/STDK_3SS_Y}
    \caption{Dependence of the mean level of a particle's spin tune on its mean energy level.

  \end{subfigure}
  \begin{subfigure}{\linewidth}
    \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{img/decoh/LPS_3SS_Y}
    \caption{Longitudinal phase space portraits of the injected particles.
      Particles were injected on different betatron orbits, hence sextupole fields modify their orbit lengths.
      Portraits compress when the fields strength is varied.\label{fig:sext:OL_effect:LPS}}
  \end{subfigure}
  \caption{Analysis of the sextupole fields' orbit length effect.}
\end{figure}

\paragraph{Conclusions}
The above analysis brought us to the following conclusions:
\begin{enumerate}[(1)]
\item The signature of the sextupole fields' momentum compaction factor effect is the change in the functional
  form of the mean spin tune dependence on the particle's mean energy level $\avg{\nu_s}(\avg{\D K/K})$.
  \item The pure orbit length effect is the reduction in the dispersion of the mean energy levels.
\end{enumerate}

Contrary to our original intuition, the minimization of the dispersion in the mean energy levels does not
effect the desired minimization in the dispersion of the perticles' spin tunes.
In Figure~\ref{fig:sext:OL_effect}, for example, we see that the sextupole gradient value corresponding to the
minimal $\SD{\D K/K}$ is not optimal in terms of $\SD{\avg{\nu_s}}$, while ar the optimal value,
the $\D K/K$ dispersion does not matter at all.

\subsubsection{Decoherence suppression in an ideal lattice}
In the lattice from Figure~\ref{fig:BNL_lattice} three families of sextupoles are used: one is to reduce spin
decoherence associated with horizontal plane betatron oscillations, one with vertical, and one with synchrotron
oscillations.

In order to test the effect of each sextupole family, we injected two planar bunches
(with particles offset from the closed orbit in, respectively, the x- and y-coordinates), and
a bunch, whose particles had non-zero inintial momentum offsets. Figure~\ref{fig:decoh:ideal}
shows the simulation results.

One can see that the parabolic term disappears when the corresponding sextupoles are turned on in each case,
which is the expected effect; the remaining linear term is insensitive to the sextupole fields. Currently,
we don't exactly know its source.

    The black line represents that dependence prior to turning on the sextupole family

    We observe that in each case the parabolic term disappears when the sextupoles are turned on.
    The remaining linear term is insensitive to the sextupole fields.
    \label{fig:decoh:ideal}}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Decoherence in an imperfect lattice}
There exists another approach to suppressing spin decoherence:
the spin wheel measurement method.~\cite{Mane:SpinWheel}
The basic idea there is to insert a solenoid generating a radial magnetic field into the
(ideal) beamline. The beam particles' spin vectors precess incoherently in the horizontal plane -- the
cause of horizontal plane decoherence.
A sufficiently high solenoid field will precess them coherently in the vertical plane. The coherent precession
is then assumed to be the dominant one, hence the conclusion that decoherence is suppressed.

The purpose of the following simulation is to show two things:
\begin{enumerate*}
\item that the spin wheel technique does not suppress decoherence,
\item that the sextupole fields technique still does even in an imperfect lattice.
\end{enumerate*}

In the simulation we used an imperfect lattice, with imperfections introduced in the same way as
in section~\ref{sec:betatron:simulation}. Because of imperfections, a radial magnetic field exists, that
simulates the introduction of a SW-driving solenoid into the beam line.

Thirty particles were distributed uniformly in the vertical plane at injection. We tracked this beam through
the lattice for $20\cdot 10^6$ turns (20 seconds). Every $2\cdot10^4$ turns particles'
spin vector components were recorded, and their dispersion (estimated as the standard deviation) was used
as a decoherence measure. In Figure~\ref{fig:decoh:imperfect:off} are shown the dispersions for the
radial and vertical spin vector components, when the sextupoles are turned off.
Figure~\ref{fig:decoh:imperfect:off:hor} shows the dispersion for the radial component, and we see that it
goes up and down within bounds but does not accummulate (which is indicated by
a statistically insignificant slope of the trend line labeled ``slp'').
This means that there is no spin decoherence in the horizontal plane when particle spin vectors precess
in the vertical plane. However, if one turns to Figure~\ref{fig:decoh:imperfect:off:vert}, one will
observe the accummulation, as evidenced by the slope of the trend line being
seven standard deviations removed from zero; meaning that decoherence just transferred from the horizontal,
into the vertical plane.

    The standard deviation is used as a (local) decoherence measure. The red trend line is used to
    characterize the global decoherence behavior.
    We observe that the slope of the trend line is statistically insignificant in the case of the radial
    spin vector component, but is sevet standard deviations removed from zero in for the vertical component.
    This means that there's no horizontal plane decoherence, but particle spin vectors disperse in the
    vertical plane.
    Sextupoles are turned off in this simulation.\label{fig:decoh:imperfect:off}}
\end{figure}

As the next step we turned on the sextupole fields.
The results are presented in Figure~\ref{fig:decoh:imperfect:on}.
We see that qualitatively nothing changed for the horizontal plane (except the dispersion bounds are
a factor of 10 less), while in the vertical plane the accummulation trend vanished. Hence we conclude
that the decoherence-suppressing effect of sextupole fields is plane-independent.

\subsection{MDM faking signal}
\subsubsection{Problem statement}
For this investigation, the primary cause for concern were machine imperfections resulting from
accelerator element tilts about the optic axis, because they induce a radial MDM angular velocity component,
which precesses particle spin vectors in the same plane as the EDM, thus resulting in a faking signal.

The standard deviation of the distribution of the erroneous spin precession angular velocity component
\begin{equation}\label{eq:MDM_freq_SD}
  \SD{\W_x^{MDM}} = \frac{q}{m\gamma} \frac{G+1}{\gamma}\frac{\SD{B_x}}{\sqrt{n}},
\end{equation}
where $n$ is the number of imperfections contributing the radial magnetic field component $B_x$
(or its equivalent $E_y$).



For the assessment of the capabilities of the frequency-based methodology, we need to answer two questions:
\begin{enumerate}[(1)]
\item Is the erroneous component independent of the particular element tilt angle distribution, i.e. is it
  a linear function $\W_x^{MDM} = L(\avg{\theta_{tilt}})$ of the \emph{mean} tilt angle?
  \item Is it (anti-)symmetric relative to time-reversal, i.e., $|\W_x^{MDM,CW}| = |\W_x^{MDM,CCW}|$?
\end{enumerate}
What these questions add up to is: will the faking signal change sign, if we inject the beam in the opposite
direction? If it does, since the EDM angular velocity will not, we can eliminate the faking signal
from the final statistic.

We analyzed the same lattice, with the same way of introducing machine imperfections, as in the previous cases.
In total, 11 simulations were done, in each of which we varied the tilt angle distribution's expectation value.
Spin and orbital transfer maps were computed up to the third order Taylor expansion; in view of
our spin decoherence suppression simulation results\footnote{Meaning, when the sextupole fields are turned on,
  spin tune becomes independent of the particle trajectory, be it the closed or any of the betatron orbits.}
we were only looking at the behavior of the closed orbit particle.
The injection energy is 270.0092 MeV (the precise FS energy for this lattice; i.e.
the invariant spin axis is radially-orientated).

\subsubsection{Results and conclusions}
\paragraph{Results}
In Figure~\ref{fig:MDM:linearity} is drawn the dependence of the spin precession angular velocity vector's
radial and vertical components on the mean E+B element tilt angle distribution. We observe that
regardless of the particular distribution, all data points lie perfectly on the same straight line,
which indicates a lack of dependence on anything but the mean angle.

\begin{figure}[h]\centering
  \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{img/fake_signal/linearity_test_shifting_gauss_freq.eps}
  \caption{Components of the spin precession angular velocity vector for the reference particle
      plotted against the mean spin-rotator tilt angle.
      Each data point corresponds to a different tilt angle distribution; however,
      the vector components do not exhibit any pattern other than the linear
      dependence on the mean angle.\label{fig:MDM:linearity}}
\end{figure}

In Figure~\ref{fig:MDM:reldiff} are presented the relative differences between the clockwise (CW) and
counter-clockwise (CCW) beams' radial invariant spin axis component and spin precession frequency at different
mean E+B tilt angles. As before, the non-zero average tilt angle is equivalent to the presence of
a spin wheel driver in the lattice. We varied the strength of the SW driver in two ranges: first in
a bigger one, then smaller. What we observed is that in both ranges the compared variables have similar
values for the CW vs CCW beams; in the case of frequency, though, the similarity is the better, the higher is
the SW driver's strength (i.e. the faster the spin wheel is rolling).

    \caption{Smaller SW driver strength range.\label{fig:MDM:reldiff:SW_small}}
  \end{subfigure}
  \caption{Relative difference between the clockwise and counter-clockwise beams'
    radial invariant spin axis component and precession frequency at different SW driver strengths.
    The compared variables are fairly similar; in the frequency case the similarity is the better, the
    greater the strength of the SW driver.\label{fig:MDM:reldiff}
  }
\end{figure}

We used Figure~\ref{fig:MDM:linearity} to estimate what vertical spin precession frequency could be expected
as a result of misalignments. Assuming the number of misaligned elements $n=100$, and
$\SD{\theta_{tilt}} = 10^{-4}$ rad,\footnote{We assume $10^{-4}$ to be the realistic element alignment precision.}
we computed $\SD{\avg{\theta_{tilt}}} = 10^{-5}$. This gives us a confidence interval estimate,
presented as Table~\ref{tbl:MDM_CI}. There's a 28\% chance to encounter a $\W_x^{MDM}\in[50, 100]$ rad/sec.

\begin{table}[h]\centering
  \caption{Probability to encounter an MDM-related EDM-faking singal less than $\W^{max}$\label{tbl:MDM_CI}}
  \begin{tabular}{rr}
    \hline
    $\W^{max}$ [rad/sec] & $P(\W_x^{MDM} < \W^{max})$ \\
    \hline
    50 & 67\% \\
    100 & 95\% \\
    \hline
  \end{tabular}
\end{table}

\paragraph{Conclusions}
\begin{enumerate}[(1)]
\item We confirmed that the MDM component of the spin precession angular velocity vector depdends only on the
  expectation value, but not the form, of the lattice's imperfection distribution,\footnote{This has been
    confirmed only for the speficic lattice we used, whose imperfections do not preturb the closed orbit.}
  i.e. its \emph{linearity}.
\item We've observed some \emph{asymmetry}, likely due to the difference between the
  CW and CCW beams' closed orbits.
\item The asymmetry is less prononuced at higher spin wheel roll rates.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Conclusions}
With regard to systematic errors originating with the particle spin dynamics in a storage ring,
we came to the following conclusions:
\begin{itemize}
\item The 2D Frozen Spin method's EDM statistic is robust with regard to perturbations from the particles'
  betatron motion.
\item Sextupole field spin decoherence suppression effect is independent of the spin vectors'
  precession plane.
\item The properties of the EDM-faking MDM signal are such as to
  \begin{itemize}
  \item necessitate the use of a frequency-based methodology;
  \item allow the exclusion of this signal from the final statistic.
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
