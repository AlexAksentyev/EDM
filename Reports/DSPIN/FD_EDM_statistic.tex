Since the measured angular velocity $\W = \W_{MDM} + \W_{EDM}$ includes a contribution due to the MDM, one has to find a way to eliminate the $\W_{MDM}$ term from the final $\hat\W_{EDM}$ estimator. 

In the proposed methodology, non-spurious $\W_{MDM}$ is generated only by the radial magnetic fields induced by accelerator element tilts about the optical axis. Therefore, by reversing the polarity of the guide field one also reverses the sign of $\W_{MDM}$. The EDM estimator is constructed as a sum of positive (beam circulates clockwise) and negative (counter-clockwise) polarity cycles' angular momentum estimates:
\begin{align}
	\W^{\pm} &= \pm \W_{MDM}^\pm + \W_{EDM},\\
	\hat\W_{EDM} &= \frac12\left[\hat\W^+ + \hat\W^-\right] \notag\\
	&= \W_{EDM} + \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\cdot\sigma_{MDM} + \epsilon,	\label{eq:EDM-estimator}
\end{align}
where
$\sigma_{MDM}$ is  the statistical (model parameter estimate) error, and the difference between the two cycles' MDM spin precession rates $\epsilon~=~\frac12\left(\W_{MDM}^+~-~\W_{MDM}^-\right)$ is the  systematic error term.
