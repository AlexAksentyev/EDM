Calibration of the effective Lorentz factor is done via observing spin precession in the closed orbit plane. For that purpose, a special transverse spin rotator element is used in order to suppress the vertical plane precession.  Using the fact that $\nu_s$ is an injective function of $\geff$, it follows that there exists a unique value $\geff^0$, at which the polarization vector is frozen with respect to the beam's momentum vector in the horizontal plane, i.e. $\nu_s=0$ in the rest frame. Since the tilt of the spin precession axis is the same for the CW and CCW beams,  
\[
\lim_{\nu_s^+ - \nu_s^- \to 0} \W_{MDM}^+ - \W_{MDM}^- = 0,
\]
and hence $\epsilon$ in equation~\eqref{eq:EDM-estimator} is removed.
