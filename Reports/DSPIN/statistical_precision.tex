Spin precession angular velocity is estimated via non-linear fit of a constant-parameter harmonic function to polarization data. However, perturbations to the spin dynamics, caused by, for example, betatron motion, introduce a mismatch between the fit model and the data, and hence a model specification systematic error. This problem has been analyzed,~\cite{Aksentev:IPAC19:SMP} with the conclusion that this systematic error is negligible.

Effective measurement cycle length cannot exceed three times the polarization lifetime $\tau_d$,~\cite{Stats} where $\tau_d$ is the time during which beam polarization decreases by a factor of $e$.

Simulation shows~\cite{Stats} the possibility of reaching a statistical error $\sigma[\hat\W]~=~8\cdot~10^{-7}$~rad/sec in one measurement cycle (at $\tau_d = 721$~sec, cycle length $10^3$~sec), and $\sigma[\avg{\hat\W}]~=~5\cdot~10^{-9}$~rad/sec in one year of measurement (at 70\% accelerator time load). This should suffice to achieve an EDM estimate precision level of $10^{-29}~e\cdot$cm.
