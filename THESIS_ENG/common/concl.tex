\begin{enumerate}
  \item Effects of spin dynamics that could potentially result in systematic error were studiedm such as:
  \begin{itemize}
  	\item betatron motion-related psrticle spin dynamics pertubrations;
  	\item spin decoherence;
  	\item machine imperfection-related EDM-faking MDM spin precession.
  \end{itemize}
  \item For each of the systematic errors, a solution was described, its effectiveness numerically analyzed.
  \item Were formulated:
  \begin{itemize}
  	\item the notions of the space and time domains (with respect to the FS SR EDM measurement methodology);
  	\item the notion of the 2D frozen spin state;
  	\item the necessary conditions of a successful SR EDM measurement;
  	\item the 2D FS (Frequency Domain) method, satisfying all of the necessary conditions we found.
  \end{itemize}
  \item Frozen and Quasi-Frozen spin lattices were described.
\end{enumerate}
