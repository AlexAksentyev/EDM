\section{FS-based methodologies}\label{chpt1:FS-methods}
In this section we first give two examples of foundational methods for searching for the EDM
in a storage ring, both of which are based on the FS idea;
then we generalize these methods to two mutually-exclusive categories;
we finish with the introduction of the 2D FS method.

We note, too, that apart from the FS method alternative approaches to the EDM measurement exist,
for example~\cite{COSY:SpinTuneMapping, COSY:Partially-Frozen-Spin}, in which the beam polarization
freely precesses about the vertical guiding field of the storage ring.
