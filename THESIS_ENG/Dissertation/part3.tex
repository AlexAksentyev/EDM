\chapter{Universal SR EDM measurement problems and their solutions} \label{chpt3:top-level}
 
Universal SR EDM measurement problems can be classified into two groups:
\begin{enumerate*}[(i)]
	\item problems that can ba solved by introducing a spin wheel, and
	\item problems needing specialized solutions.
\end{enumerate*}

Problems of the first category follow from the instability of the invariant spin axis. Among those are,
for example, local electromagnetic field perturbaitons, as well as perturbations to the particle
spin dynamics caused by betatron oscillations. In both cases the particle invariant spin axis deviates from
is equilibrium (closed orbit) orientation for a short period of time.

Problems needing specific solutions include spin decoherence and EDM-faking MDM spin precession. In this part we
analyze the essence of each of these problems, describe their possible solutions, and perform corresponding
simulations.

\section{Spin decoherence}\label{chpt3:decoherence}
Spin coherence refers to a measure or quality of preservation of polarizaion
in an initially fully-polarized beam.~\cite[p.~205]{Eremey:Thesis}

The spin vectors of a polarized beam injected into a storage ring
begin precessing about the vertical (guiding) field. The precession frequency
depends on the particle equilibrium energy level, which differs across the beam particles.

This circumstance doesn't pose a problem when the beam is vertically polarized;
however, the FS SR EDM measurement method requires that the polarization vector be aligned with
the beam's momentum vector, i.e. lay in the horizontal plane. Hence, spin decoherence is an
inherent problem of the FS methodology.

In the present section we analyze the origins of spin decoherence,
the sextupole method of its suppression, as well as the simulation results
proving the effectiveness of the method.

As an introduction, though, we estimate the spin coherence time required for
the measurement of the EDM in the framework of the space domain methodology.

\section{Machine imperfections error}\label{chpt3:imperfections}
Systematic errors due to physical imperfections of the accelerator lattice, including
optical element misalignments, are causative to an EDM-faking signal 
related to MDM spin precession~\cite[p.~230]{Eremey:Thesis} Rotational magnet misalignments 
are particularly problematic in this respect, since they induce parasitic horizontal magnetic field
components $B_x$ and $B_z$, both of which precess spin in the vertical plane; the one in which
the EDM is searched for.

Y. Senichev made analytical estimates~\cite{Senichev:FDM}  of the radial component of
the spin precession angular velocity. From the T-BMT equation, and the expression for
the Lorentz force, its radial component can be expressed as 
\begin{equation}
\SD{\W_x^{MDM}} = \frac{q}{m\gamma}\frac{G+1}{\gamma}\frac{\SD{B_x}}{\sqrt{n}},
\end{equation}
where $n$ is the number of tilted spin-rotator elements,~\footnote{The estimates were made for
the FS lattice described in section~\ref{chpt2:lattice:FS_BNL}.} and $\SD{B_x} = B_y \SD{\delta h}/L$, 
with the misalignment error standard deviation $\SD{\delta h}$. Assuing $\SD{\delta h} = 100$~$\mu$m, 
and spin-rotator length $L=1$ ~m, $\SD{\W_x^{MDM}} \approx 100$ rad/sec.~\cite{Senichev:FDM}

We analyzed the particle spin dynamics in the imperfect FS and QFS lattices using COSY Infinity.~\cite{COSYINF:Website} 
Our simulation results tend to confirm the above estimates.

\section{Guide field flipping}\label{chpt3:GFF}

Two aspects of the problem need to be paid attention to:
\begin{enumerate}
\item What needs to be kept constant from one measurement cycle to the next;
\item How it can be observed.
\end{enumerate}

The goal of flipping the direction of the guide field is to accurately reproduce the radial component
of the MDM spin precession frequency induced by machine imperfection fields. This point should not be overlooked:
a mere reproduction of the \emph{magnetic field strength} would not suffice, since the injection point of
the beam's centroid,
and hence its orbit length --- and, via equations~\eqref{eq:EffectiveGamma} and~\eqref{eq:spin_tune_vs_gamma},
spin tune, --- is subject to variation. (Apart from that, the accelerating structure might not be symmetrical,
in terms of spin dynamics, with regard to reversal of the beam circulation direction.)

What needs to be reproduced, therefore, is not the field strength, but the effective Lorentz factor of
the centroid.

Regarding the second question, we mentioned earlier that the Koop Wheel roll rate
is controlled through measurement of the horizontal plane spin precession frequency. 
This plane was chosen because the EDM angular velocity vector points
(mainly) in the radial direction; its vertical component is due to machine imperfection fields,
and is small compared to
the measured EDM effect. Therefore, in first approximation, when we manipulate the vertical component of the 
combined spin precession angular velocity, we manipulate the vertical component of the MDM
angular velocity vector.

The effective Lorentz factor calibraion procedure consists in the following.

\section{Spin tune equivalence of trajectories of equal effective Lorentz factor}\label{sec:spin_tune_traj_equivalence}
In the context of the spin wheel roll direction change procedure, it is important to consider the question
of the CW and CCW beams' equivalence in trems of their spin dynamics.

Our analysis starts from Statement 1: particles having an equal effective Lorentz factor value have equal
spin tunes, i.e. are equivalent in their spin dynamics. This is a consequence of
equation~\eqref{eq:spin_tune_vs_gamma}.

In the next sections we will consider two formulations of Statement 1:
\begin{enumerate}[A.]
	\item when interpreting the effective L-factor as the expectation value of the particle energy;
	\item the multivariate function $\nu_s(x, a, y, b, \ell, \delta)$ is agnostic to the paricle's
          trajectory in the transverse phase planes $(x,a)$, and $(y,b)$, that is, it can be reduced
          to a multivariable function $\nu_s(\g*)$.
\end{enumerate}
