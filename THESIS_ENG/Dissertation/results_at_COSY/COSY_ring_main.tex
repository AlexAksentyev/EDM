The COSY accelerator facility depicted in Figure~\ref{fig:COSY_Ring} consists of two sources of unpolarized \Hm/\Dm-ions and one source of polarized \Hm ions, the injector cyclotron JULIC (J\"ulich Light Ion Cyclotron)~\cite{JULIC-Injector} capable of accelerating the \Hm-ions up to 300 MeV/c and \Dm-ions up to 600 MeV/c, and the cooler synchrotron ring COSY with a circumference 184 m accelerating protons and deuterons
up to 3.3 GeV/c.~\cite{COSY-Ring}

Injection into COSY is done via charge exchange of the negative ions over 20 ms with a linearly decreasing
closed orbit bump at the position of the stripper foil. The polarized source delivers 10 $\mu$A of polarized \Hm-ions.~\cite{COSY-Ring}

Two types of beam cooling are available: electron (energy range in the ``old'' and ``new'' electron coolers: 20--100 keV and 20--2,000 keV, respectively) and stochastic.

The two electron coolers installed in the straight sections are capable of cooling the beam in the full possible energy range. Stochastic cooling works in the momentum range 1.5-3.7 GeV/c.

Beam polarization is continuously monitored  by an internal polarimeter EDDA; recently, an additional polarimeter making use of WASA forward detectors was set up, and a new polarimeter, based on LYSO-scintillators, is under development and will be installed in the COSY ring in 2019.
Proton polarization of 75\% can be achieved up to the highest momentum levels; deuteron vector and tensor polarizations reach up to 60\%.~\cite[\textbf{Historical background}]{YellowReport}
