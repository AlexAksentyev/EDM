The proposed method aims at solving the geometric phase and machine imperfection systematic errors, which are
encountered in any Frozen Spin Storage Ring EDM measurement method based on observation of a slow, gradual
change in the beam polarization vector.

Geometric phase can be handled by dispensing with operation in the spin resonance (i.e., 3D Frozen Spin) state,
in favor of the 2D FS state, generated by a Spin Wheel. In order to eliminate the machine imperfection
systematic error, the imperfection fields themselves are utilized as a spin wheel.

The method is intended for a combined storage ring (bend fields are magnetic).
The imperfection fields spin wheel roll direction flipping, required by the SW methodology,
is executed via reversal of the guide field polarity. The spin wheel roll rate is controlled
via spin tune measurement.
