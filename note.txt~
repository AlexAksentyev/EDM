1000 seconds experiment time comes from the Frozen Spin ring concept, in which there's no spin precession due to the magnetic field and hence the vertical component of the beam polarization is measured. The EDM is supposed to turn it at 1e-9 rad/sec, we can measure angles at the level of 1e-6 rad, therefore --- 1000 seconds measurement time.
