====== Experiment ======
Created Friday 17 March 2017

We measure the EDM by estimating the spin precession frequency in the vertical plane. The spin of a particle precesses for two reasons: the MDM and EDM. 

===== The reference particle model =====

==== FS machine ====
In the ideal FS machine, as a result of the reference particle's having magic energy, the spin precession in the vertical plane is only due to the EDM.
