====== Experiment ======
Created Friday 17 March 2017

[[../../TheFourConcepts.pdf|The four concepts]] in the foundation of the JEDI experiment are:
	A. Boundary factors:
		1. Measure frequency;
		2. Confounding;
	B. Procedures:
		1. CW/CCW;
		2. Calibration.

==== Modeling of CW/CCW ====

Distribute tilt error => Transfer map.
Track/Spin tune/&c => Spin Motion Characteristic (1). 
Reverse injection direction (map). 
Track/Spin tune/&c => SPC (2). 
Compare SMC (1) & SMC (2) => statistic.
Repeat many times => Statistic distribution.

Analyze the statistic distribution and conclude if/under what constriction of the error distribution we can get it sufficiently narrow.

==== Modeling of Calibration ====

Turn on solenoid (turn off vertical precession). // Transfer map w/solenoid on
Set B_{y}.
Compute {{./equation.png?type=equation}}.
Turn off solenoid (turn on vertical precession). // Transfer map w/solenoid off
Compute {{./equation001.png?type=equation}}.
