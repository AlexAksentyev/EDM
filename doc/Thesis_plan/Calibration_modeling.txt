====== Calibration modeling ======
Created Wednesday 12 July 2017

1. For a given ensemble of rays, compute Wx => (x, Wx).
2. Make Wx = 0 by adjusting the perpendicular solenoid magnetic field strength.
3. Compute Wy.
4. Revert the transfer map, repeat 2.
5. Adjust the beam energy to make Wy(REV) = Wy(FWD).
6. Turn off the solenoid, compute Wx.
7. Compare Wx(REV) to Wx(FWD).

I have an ensemble of rays varying in x and d. I track the ensemble spins and compute the precession frequencies Wx, Wy under two conditions: Bsol=0 & (Bsol : Wx=0). That gives me [(Wx, Wy)_FWD](x, d). I repeat the same for the reversed map, get [(Wx, Wy)_REV](x, d).
