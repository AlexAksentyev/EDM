====== Thesis plan ======
Created Tuesday 14 March 2017

1. Frozen-/Quasi-Frozen Spin lattice concepts.
	a. Measured quantities;
	b. Required experimental conditions;
	c. Devices (on the beam line) to set those conditions & measure those quantities.
2. The spin-orbital motion in FS and QFS rings. (Ideal.)
3. Consequences of imperfections in the lattice. (How the spin-orbital motion changes from the ideal.)
4. Investigation of systematic errors. (How the deviation from the ideal increases our uncertainty in the value of the EDM.)
5. Parameters of the ring for the CDR. (... that ensure sufficient reduction of that uncertainty.)
