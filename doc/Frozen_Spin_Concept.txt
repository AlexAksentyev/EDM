====== Frozen Spin Concept ======
Created Tuesday 14 March 2017

From [[~/.mozilla/firefox/uddpttsa.default/zotero/storage/XNZFMH6S/Link to original.pdf|this]] paper.

The idea is to adjust the beam energy to a value at which the spin precession due to the anomalous magnetic moment does not occur. (**#Condition**) In this case, the __beam polarization__ precesses only due to the EDM, at a rate of about 1e-9 rad/sec, and we can measure the growth of its __vertical component__. (**#MeasuredQuantity**)

A vertically polarized bunched (**why **bunched**? why** is it de-/re-bunched**?**) beam is injected into the ring; its polarization is rotated (by means of an **RF-solenoid**) onto the longitudinal plane (so that the vertical polarization component is zero), from which it slowly turns away due to the EDM. A measurable change in the vertical component would be on the order of 1e-6 rad, //therefore// the need to keep the beam alive for 1e3 sec. This imposes conditions on the vaccuum.

Only 1% of all scatterings are spin-dependent nuclear elastic scattering.

The presence of a non-zero average B-field induces a vertical spin precession, hence the **uncertainty** of how much polarization growth is due to the EDM, and how much to the <Br>.

For some reason (**why?**), the vertical separation between the CW and CCW beam positions is important. Non-zero average radial B-field induces a separation on the order of a picometer, hence the need to use BPMs with a picometer resolution.

The separation is probably important because the beams circulate in the ring //simultaneously//, and there's a pull between them, which depends on the separation. This pull force is actually a sistematic error (**why?**); one which is controlled (estimated) by measuring the beam positions.

===== Summary =====
Measured quantity: the vertical component of the beam polarization.
Conditions:
	* ``Magic`` beam energy (to null the MDM precession)
	* at least 1000 seconds beam storage time
		* vaccuum better than 1e-10 Torr
